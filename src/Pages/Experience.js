        Much of my professional experience is in the financial services industry
        in lending and marketing while the majority of my software engineering
        experience is either through school or personal projects. However, you may
        notice that sprinkled throughout my financial career are several
        software skills that I believe transfer wonderfully to
        software engineering (along with all my soft skills)!
